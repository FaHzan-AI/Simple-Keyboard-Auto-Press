From the **KeyboardAuto.py** file, the following dependencies are required for the program to run properly:

1. **tkinter** (included by default in Python)
2. **keyboard** (needs to be installed manually)
3. **ttk** (part of tkinter, already included)
4. **threading** (included by default in Python)
5. **time** (included by default in Python)

The only external dependency that needs to be installed is **keyboard**. You can install it using:

```bash
pip install keyboard
```

To ensure all dependencies are available, you can also run:

```bash
pip install keyboard tk
```

However, **tk** is usually included with Python by default.
